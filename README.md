# Health-Sleuth

An ML model which investigates and predicts a person's risk of having diabetes, depression or hypertension.

Diseases such as diabetes, depression and hypertension are a bit hard to diagnose properly. Take the example of hypertension, your blood pressure could rise due to anxiety when you visit the doctor - this condition is known as whitecoat hypertension and it increases the chances of misdiagnosis. On the other hand, some people have masked hypertension. Depression affects one in three people with hypertension while one in four patients with diabetes have depression. It is estimated that one out of three adults has hypertension and that more than 50% of them are unaware of this condition.
Our lifestyle has a lot of impact on these diseases. Baseline daily and non-daily smoking was associated with depression .Low physical activity and heavy alcohol drinking were associated with persistent depression.
We wanted to create a project to conduct a health-investigation and diagnose a person with high or low risk of these diseases based on their lifestyle parameters.

Health sleuth is essentially a disease-investigator which investigates about our health and risk to diabetes, depression and hypertension. It is a machine learning model which takes in some clues from the user to conduct the investigation and can predict whether  a person has low or high risk of diabetes, depression and hypertension. Health Sleuth also predicts if a person is completely healthy or not.
